# Overview
This is the project to collect the NFT information on Bored Ape Yacht Club (https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub) through scraping. I collected all apes with “Solid gold” fur data. After scraping using Selenium, I stored each ape's information in a document inside a **MongoDB**.

The following image shows information about a Bored Ape Yacht Club stored in MongoDB.
